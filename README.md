# Management-Traffic-Control--C-Plus-Plus
About Traffic Control Management Project:
The project source code consists of two cpp files( main.cpp and caliberate.cpp) and a user defined header file(caleberate.h). The main.cpp file in the source code integrates all files and makes do the designed task of the project.

In Traffic Control Management System, the major function of user defined header file is to make the system capture the video of the traffic lanes and to analyze them. The caliberate.cpp receives the analyzed data of running traffic and it takes the appropriate decision for traffic control.

The application detects traffic by using opencv. The algorithm provides necessary traffic information required for analysis and decision making in traffic management. The major information to be detected and analyzed for traffic management by this application are:

Average movement of vehicles
Percentage of area covered by vehicles on the road
This software analyses the traffic for each lane decides to divide the traffic based on type of vehicle. In order to reduce traffic congestion, the small vehicles are moved in one lane and heavier vehicle vehicles are moved in other.
